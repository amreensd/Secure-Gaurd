In the digital age, security is paramount, especially when it comes to accessing sensitive systems
or information. The "Secure guard: Unauthorized Access Detection System‚Äù aims to enhance security
measures by detecting and capturing images of unauthorized users attempting to access a secure system.The
system employs a user-friendly graphical interface that prompts users to enter a password for authentication.
Upon entering an incorrect password more than three times, the system utilizes the device's camera to
capture the image of the unauthorized user.By implementing "Secure Guard," organizations can bolster their
security measures, safeguard sensitive information, and mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized
access attempts. The system serves as a valuable tool in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of
digital systems and resources.
